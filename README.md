# ThingsJuniorProgrammersNeedToKnow
I am a junior deep learning researcher and a data engineer(scientist), and have done many trials. In a hope that others don't repeat my errors, I made a repository to organize the things that junior developers need to know.

# Dev Trees
- AboutDocker

# Research Trees
- TODO

All the codes and descriptions are written in the perspective of a junior developer.
Any comments or feedbacks are welcomed.
My objective is to enable a newbie to get under his/her way as fast as possible.
So, too much details or theoretic descriptions may be intentionally omitted.
They will be added in near future.
